        -> Encapsulation
        -> Inheritance
        ->
        ->

    1.  Encapsulation :-> Encaptulation is nothing but binding the data members and member functions into a single unit called Encaptulation.
                          Wrapping up data members(properties/state) and member functions(methods/behaviour).
                          Information Hiding / Data Hiding

            -> Fully Encapsulation Class :- all Data Members marked as private.

            Advantage :- .Data Hiding.
                         .if we want, we can make class read only.
                         .code reusability.
                         .better for unit testing.
    
    2.  Inheritance :-> Inheritance is the process of derieving a new class or classes from existing old class or classes.
                        In other words, It is also called it is the process of passing the properties of one class to another.
                        In this situation, The old class is referred as base class/super class and the newly created class is called derieved/sub class.
                        It provides the concept of reusibility and extendibility.

            Types of Inheritance :-

                -> Single :- It is the mechanism of derieving a class from only one base class.

                -> Multi-level :- It is the process of deriving a new class from another derived class.

                -> Multiple :- It is the process of derieving a new class by using of more than one base classes;

                -> Hybrid :- In this Inheritance, we are deriving the classes by using more than one Inheritance model.
                             Combination of more than 1 type o inheritance.

                -> Heirarchical :- When Multiple sub class is created from only one superclass is called Hierarchical inheritance.
